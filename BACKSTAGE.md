Welcome to the **Inter IKEA Retail Package** developer portal.

The business goal and impact of the developer portal is to enable sharing of information with internal parties and external parties, lower the effort/cost and standardize the operational process.

The overall functional goals of the portal are:

- Publishing API specifications using standard formats (Swagger, OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, GraphQL)

- Support versioning of APIs, alternative endpoints

- Usable mock/test surface for API specifications (sample payloads etc)

- Share specific components, documentation segments and APIs with internal (Inter IKEA AD users) and external users

- Granular security and segmentation for sharing information (**note: coming in Q4**)

- Searchable API catalog

- Searchable services/components catalog

- Share documentation using standard markdown

- Connect to existing resources in GitHub

- Workflows for requesting and registering API keys (**note: work planned and in progress**)
